Area-Book
=========

A way for ward leaders to track and manage their efforts to care for the ward.

This is the code that ldsareabook.org runs on. Here are some facts and functions:

1. Anyone can create an account and a ward area book for their unit.
2. The ward area book tracks visits and attempts to contact members of the ward. This is meant to facilitate communication between the Ward Council in order to allow them to focus on the needs and well-being of individuals and families in the ward.
3. The ward area book also tracks visits and attempts to contact investigators as a way to assist the Ward Mission Leader and Full-Time Missionaries in reporting on the progress of investigators and make the Ward Council aware of needed assistance.
4. Each area book has limited access. First, before any one has access to your area book you must accept their request to view it. Individuals can only be memebrs of one area book at a time.
5. All member information is encrypted. In addition to approving individuals for access, each area book has a password that you can set and change as needed. This password is necessary in order to decrypt any information in the area book. This password is never stored on the server database so even someone who has server access cannot view any member information without the decryption password you have chosed.
6. Since ward passwords are not stored anywhere in the server database, if you lose it, your data is gone forever. So be sure to store this some place safe.
7. By tracking the Ward Council's outreach efforts, a nice story is generated over time for each family. That way, as leadership changes, data is not lost but easily passed on to the next responsible party.
8. This service is completely free and always will be.
